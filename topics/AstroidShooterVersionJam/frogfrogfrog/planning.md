Asteroid Shooter – Game Concept

Core Mechanics:

Spaceship Control: Move left and right with the mouse. Shoot bullets upward toward horizontally moving asteroids.

Asteroids: Enter from one side of the screen and move straight across. If an asteroid reaches the opposite side, the player loses a life.

Lives: Players start with 3 lives. Losing all lives ends the game, but earned money is saved.

Money & Multiplier: Destroying asteroids rewards money. Higher scores increase a multiplier, boosting earnings.

Levels: Progression is tied to money. Each level introduces faster, smaller, or more numerous asteroids, along with new backgrounds and music. The final level requires destroying 5 special asteroids to win.

UI: Displays current money, multiplier, lives, and level.

Optional / Future Features:

Dynamic asteroid effects (explosions, shrinking, unique shapes)

Shop for upgrades, power-ups, or customization

Background themes with planets, nebulae, or moving objects

More complex uses of money and multipliers
