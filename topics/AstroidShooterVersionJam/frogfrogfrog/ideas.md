Premise:
The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen using the mouse. Asteroids fly horizontally across the screen from left to right (or right to left), and the player must shoot them before they reach the opposite side. Destroying asteroids earns money, while letting one pass costs a life. The goal is to survive, accumulate wealth, and progress through increasingly difficult levels, culminating in a final challenging stage.
