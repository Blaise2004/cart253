            <p>
        With a crack and what feels like being pulled through the eye of a needle, I am hurled forward. The world twists,
        compresses, and snaps. For a moment I am nothing but pressure and motion. Then, suddenly, I am released.
        
        I spill out of whatever that place was, as if I’ve been vomited out of a quantum state. My body reforms piece by piece,
        sensations returning in slow waves. The air is sharp and real. Solid ground holds me up. It takes me a moment to
        understand that I am back.
        
        I look down at my hands.

    <p>
Not a shifting creature.
Not data.
Not light.

Paper.

A print.

The bug’s body is there, flattened and still, captured in ink. The patents that once swirled around it are reduced to
shapes, lines, marks pressed into the page. Its presence is quiet now, muted, held in place by the physical. No
glitching. No pull. Just a frozen form, contained within the limits of this world.

I breathe out, finally steady.

This is my place.
Somewhere it cannot slip through, cannot rewrite itself, cannot follow the currents it once lived inside. Here, it is
trapped in the grid of the print, bound by the dots of ink.

I’ve beaten it.

And I’m not going back.
